I was only supposed to run a routine check. But when I logged in, The Old Terminal 
activated; a long-forgotten backup system from the early days of computing.

They left The Old Terminal running because they thought it was harmless. Just an 
obsolete failsafe. But it's still following orders.

Orders no one remembers.

Zach Lloyd saw this coming. Before he vanished, he left behind a final failsafe, 
buried deep in the mainframe - a message hidden inside 'zach_message.enc'.

It's too late for me. But not for you.

Find the last command. Before it dooms us all.
